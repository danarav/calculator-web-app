# Calculator

## A fully functional calculator app written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript (uses jQuery library) 



My goal with building this project was to practice implementing HTML, CSS, and Javascript into a fully functional web application. This is my first ever solo-project built using these technologies. The calculator works similar to Apple's IOS "Calculator" app. First, I designed the calculator UI using Figma. I then began building the app with HTML, listing all the elements the app should have. Then I styled the calculator with CSS matching the design I created in Figma. I finally built in the logic into the calculator app using Javascript. I used the jQuery library in my Javascript.



Features:
* AC   ->   Clears all data on calculator
* +/-  ->   Changes the number on screen to positive/negative
* %    ->   Returns the percentage of a number
* Operators: รท, ร, -, +, =
